We are making an IOS App that accepts an audio file. The audio file will be transcribed into English using Whisper Distilled. Then the app will use BART to summarize the transcribed audio. Then the app will send the summarized information to T5 Small QG HL to turn the data into note cards. And send those to the IOS app.
